Game development is an enjoyable and challenging way to learn software engineering principles with a graphic component. In fact, making games can cover a wide variety of topics in computer science including graphics, I/O, networking, artificial intelligence, data science, and, most importantly, writing code. For these reasons game development can be an excellent way to practice your skills and learn new ones.

In the past, game developers would first create a game engine to handle physics, graphics, collisions, and other common game-related events before actually developing games. However, nowadays freemium engines like [Unity](www.unity.com) and [Unreal Engine](www.unrealengine.com) allow you to create games for nearly any device for free. Literally thousands of games are published using these engines every year but here is a small sampling of titles:

**Unity:** Hollow Knight, Cuphead, Rust, Stranded Deep, Hearthstone, Cities: Skylines

**Unreal Engine:** Fortnite, Ark, Biomutant, Yoshi’s Crafted World, Street Fighter V, Borderlands 3

Making games has never been faster or easier and it allows you to learn and practice core computer science principles while expressing yourself through an artistic medium.


## Game Development Overview

Game development can really be whatever you want it to be: It is your game after all. However, there are two main components that would be hard to make a game without, graphics and coding.

A **graphic designer** largely focuses on the components of a game the user sees. They may be digital artists, 3D modelers, or animators. Designers could also contribute to a game through story writing, voice acting, music writing, or creating the game world.

A **game developer** deals with the code behind the game that the user interacts with. Their role is to make sure the game functions as intended through coding. Developers may focus on principles outside the source code as well like networking, quality assurance, and platform-specific changes.

Games may also require a **publisher** to handle the marketing and support side of development. Typically, this is done by a third party outside of development but some developers may choose to self-publish.

### Alex Bailey - 6/7/2021

I think the very best way to learn game development is to choose an engine, download it, and make a game. Start as simple as possible at first and build upon it as you learn new features of your engine. In my opinion Unity is the best engine to start on as it has documentation, tutorials, and assets for absolutely everything. Additionally, Unity uses C# for scripting which is almost syntactically identical to Java (Don’t learn UnityScript!).

My greatest advice for game development is to make games that you would actually play. This will certainly keep you motivated and spiritually invested in your game which users will be able to see in the final product. Make sure you also focus on the parts of game development where you can be that invested. For example, if you like the art component more than the coding, then maybe make a game that relies more on the user’s visual experience like Hollow Knight or The Witness and find another developer for the coding part. If you like coding more than the artistic part you might consider games like Minecraft or Stardew Valley and buy the graphic components.

Lastly, don’t stress over developing your game. It may be daunting to play games worth millions or billions of dollars and try to mirror that success. Making games is an expression of you like singing, painting, or dancing. Create something you believe in and you enjoy creating.
